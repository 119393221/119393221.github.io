 <br>I spent the summer of 2019 working in a restaurant. </br>
 In this workplace I took orders, worked on the till, made sandwiches and salads and served the food to the customers.

  <p>
   <br>From the summer of 2016 to the summer of 2018, I worked in a shop . Here I worked on the till,</br>
   <br>therefore I spent my days dealing with customers and handling cash.</br>
   <br> I also worked in the deli by making sandwiches, cooking the necessary food for the hot counter and preparing food for the following days. </br>

   <p>
   <br>Through my 4th year work experience In secondary school, </br>
   <br>I spent a week in a pharmacy learning about all the different medicines and quantities of how much each medicine a patients might need.</br>
   <br>I communicated with the patients and had a very fulfilling week learning about how a pharmacist works and their tasks each day. </br>

<p>
   <br>I spent another week in an accounting firm in which I dealt with numbers, organised folders and met with the accountantâ€™s clients.</br>
   <br>I learned about bookkeeping, tax preparations, auditing and general documentation. I learned how accurate and precise accountants need to be.</br>
   <br>This was a very interesting week for me, and I gained experience and knowledge in the places I worked and potentially would work in the future. </br>
